# PromptDC - Vibe Coding Prompting

## Fix your prompts in one keyboard click!

Have you ever been frustrated by constantly repeating yourself, making typos, or typing **“FIX THIS”** over and over?

That happens all the time. When vibe coding, it’s easy to make typos or write prompts that aren’t clear. People often find themselves going back to old versions because the AI didn’t understand the prompt and made the wrong changes. But in reality, it’s usually not the AI’s fault — it’s the **PROMPT**.

That’s why PromptDC was created. It enhances your prompts with one keyboard click, without leaving VS Code. Just write your prompt in the chat and press your keyboard shortcut.

## How It Works

1. **Write your prompt in the chat**
2. **Press your keyboard shortcut**
3. **PromptDC enhances your prompt**
4. **Automatically replaces your prompt with the enhanced version**

## How Enhance Works

Based on the AI model (Copilot or Cline) you’re using, our extension reads its system prompt, understands how that model operates, and then refines and restructures your input to make it more understandable. This helps the model generate better, more accurate results.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `ctrl+alt+e` (Windows/Linux) or `cmd+ctrl+e` (Mac)

## What’s the Difference Without PromptDC?

See for yourself. Here’s a real-world example of how PromptDC improves your prompt:

# Extension Settings

The settings are located at the bottom right of VS Code, below the chat (status bar). If you have hidden the status bar, you won’t be able to see it. To make it visible, enable the status bar from **Customize Layout**.
