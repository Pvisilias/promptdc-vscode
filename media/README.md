## Tips for Creating Media

### For GIFs:
- Use tools like LICEcap, ScreenToGif, or Gyazo
- Keep file sizes under 3MB (preferably under 2MB)
- Frame rate: 10-15 FPS is sufficient
- Duration: 3-10 seconds per GIF
- Show cursor movements clearly
- Use consistent VS Code theme (preferably dark)

### For Images:
- Use high-resolution screenshots (Retina/2x if possible)
- Consistent VS Code theme across all screenshots
- Clean, uncluttered interface
- Highlight important UI elements
- Use your brand colors where appropriate

### Recording Best Practices:
1. Clean desktop/VS Code workspace
2. Close unnecessary tabs/panels  
3. Use readable font sizes
4. Show realistic but simple examples
5. Keep animations smooth and not too fast
6. Include subtle highlights for important elements

## File Naming Convention
- Use descriptive, lowercase names with hyphens
- Include dimensions in filename if helpful
- Keep extensions lowercase (.png, .gif)

## GitHub Raw URLs
The README.md uses GitHub raw URLs like:
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/promptdc/vscode-extension/main/media/filename.png`

Make sure to:
1. Add all media files to this folder
2. Commit and push to your repository
3. Update the URLs in README.md if your repo structure differs
4. Test all image links after publishing

## Optimization
- Compress images using tools like TinyPNG
- Optimize GIFs using tools like EZGIF
- Consider WebP format for better compression (though PNG/GIF have better compatibility)
